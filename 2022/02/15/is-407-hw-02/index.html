<h1>Lab1 - Nobel laureates</h1>
<p>In January 2017, Buzzfeed published an article on why Nobel laureates show immigration is so important for American science.
You can read the article <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/immigration-and-science">here</a>.
In the article they show that while most living Nobel laureates in the sciences are based in the US, many of them were born in other countries.
This is one reason why scientific leaders say that immigration is vital for progress.
In this lab we will work with the data from this article to recreate some of their visualizations as well as explore new questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-goals" class="section level1">
<h1>Learning goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Collaborating on GitHub and resolving merge conflicts</li>
<li>Replicating published results</li>
<li>Data wrangling and visualisation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="lab-prep" class="section level1">
<h1>Lab prep</h1>
<p>You have two tasks you should complete before the lab:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task 1:</strong> Read the Buzzfeed article titled <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/immigration-and-science"><em>These Nobel Prize Winners Show Why Immigration Is So Important For American Science</em></a><em>.</em> We will replicate this analysis in the workshop so it‚Äôs crucial that you‚Äôre familiar with it ahead of time.</li>
<li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Read about merge conflicts below. The merge conflict exercise we‚Äôll start with during the lab will assume that you have this background information.</li>
</ul>
<div id="merges-and-merge-conflicts" class="section level2">
<h2>Merges and merge conflicts</h2>
<p>This is the first time you‚Äôre working in teams, so we‚Äôre going to make things a little more interesting and let all of you make changes and push those changes to your team repository.
Sometimes things will go swimmingly, and sometimes you‚Äôll run into merge conflicts.
So our first task today is to walk you through a merge conflict!</p>
<ul>
<li>Pushing to a repo replaces the code on GitHub with the code you have on your computer.</li>
<li>If a collaborator has made a change to your repo on GitHub that you haven‚Äôt incorporated into your local work, GitHub will stop you from pushing to the repo because this could overwrite your collaborator‚Äôs work!</li>
<li>So you need to explicitly ‚Äúmerge‚Äù your collaborator‚Äôs work before you can push.</li>
<li>If your and your collaborator‚Äôs changes are in different files or in different parts of the same file, git merges the work for you automatically when you *pull*.</li>
<li>If you both changed the same part of a file, git will produce a **merge conflict** because it doesn‚Äôt know how which change you want to keep and which change you want to overwrite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Git will put conflict markers in your code that look like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD 

See also: [dplyr documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)   

======= 

See also [ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)  

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some1alpha2numeric3string4</code></pre>
<p>The <code>===</code>s separate <em>your</em> changes (top) from <em>their</em> changes (bottom).</p>
<p>Note that on top you see the word <code>HEAD</code>, which indicates that these are your changes.</p>
<p>And at the bottom you see <code>some1alpha2numeric3string4</code> (well, it probably looks more like <code>28e7b2ceb39972085a0860892062810fb812a08f</code>).</p>
<p>This is the <strong>hash</strong> (a unique identifier) of the commit your collaborator made with the conflicting change.</p>
<p>Your job is to <em>reconcile</em> the changes: edit the file so that it incorporates the best of both versions and delete the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>===</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> lines.
Then you can stage and commit the result.</p>
</div>

<div id="merge-conflict-activity" class="section level1">
<h1>Merge conflict activity</h1>
<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repo and open the .Rmd file.</li>
<li>Assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to each of the team members. If your team has fewer than 4 people, some people will need to have multiple numbers. If your team has more than 4 people, some people will need to share some numbers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="lets-cause-a-merge-conflict" class="section level2">
<h2>Let‚Äôs cause a merge conflict!</h2>
<p>Our goal is to see two different types of merges: first we‚Äôll see a type of merge that git can‚Äôt figure out on its own how to do on its own (a <strong>merge conflict</strong>) and requires human intervention, then another type of where that git can figure out how to do without human intervention.</p>
<p>Doing this will require some tight choreography, so pay attention!</p>
<p>Take turns in completing the exercise, only one member at a time.
<strong>Others should just watch, not doing anything on their own projects (this includes not even pulling changes!)</strong> until they are instructed to.
If you feel like you won‚Äôt be able to resist the urge to touch your computer when it‚Äôs not your turn, we recommend putting your hands in your pockets or sitting on them!</p>
<p><strong>Before starting</strong>: everyone should have the repo cloned and know which role number(s) they are.</p>
<p><strong>Role 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change the team name to your actual team name.</li>
<li>Knit, commit, push.</li>
</ul>
<p>üõë Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Role 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change the team name to some other word.</li>
<li>Knit, commit, push. You should get an error.</li>
<li>Pull. Take a look at the document with the merge conflict.</li>
<li>Clear the merge conflict by editing the document to choose the correct/preferred change.</li>
<li>Knit.</li>
<li><strong>Click the Stage checkbox</strong> for all files in your Git tab. Make sure they all have check marks, not filled-in boxes.</li>
<li>Commit and push.</li>
</ul>
<p>üõë Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Role 3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change the a label of the first code chunk</li>
<li>Knit, commit, push. You should get an error.</li>
<li>Pull. No merge conflicts should occur, but you should see a message about merging.</li>
<li>Now push.</li>
</ul>
<p>üõë Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Role 4:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change the label of the first code chunk to something other than previous role did.</li>
<li>Knit, commit, push. You should get an error.</li>
<li>Pull. Take a look at the document with the merge conflict. Clear the merge conflict by choosing the correct/preferred change. Commit, and push.</li>
</ul>
<p>üõë Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone:</strong> Pull, and observe the changes in your document.</p>

<div id="tips-for-collaborating-via-github" class="section level2">
<h2>Tips for collaborating via GitHub</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always pull first before you start working.</li>
<li>Resolve a merge conflict (commit and push) <em>before</em> continuing your work. Never do new work while resolving a merge conflict.</li>
<li>Knit, commit, and push often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.</li>
<li>If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions ASAP. Don‚Äôt let it linger and get bigger.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Go to the course GitHub organization and locate your lab repo, which should be named <code>lab1-YourTeamNumber</code>.
Grab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio.
First, open the R Markdown document <code>lab1.Rmd</code> and Knit it.
Make sure it compiles without errors.
The output will be in the file markdown <code>.md</code> file with the same name.</p>
<div id="warm-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Warm up</h2>
<p>Before we introduce the data, let‚Äôs warm up with some simple exercises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the YAML, changing the author name to your team number (e.g., ‚ÄúTeam 1‚Äù), and <strong>knit</strong> the document.</li>
<li>Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.</li>
<li>Push your changes to GitHub.</li>
<li>Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd <strong>and</strong> md files. If anything is missing, commit and push again.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>We‚Äôll use the <strong>tidyverse</strong> package for much of the data wrangling.
You can load them by running the following in your Console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The dataset for this assignment can be found as a CSv (comma separated values) file in the <code>data</code> folder of your repository.
You can read it in using the following.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nobel &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/nobel.csv&quot;) # Or, you can use nobel &lt;- ezpickr::pick(&quot;data/nobel.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The variable descriptions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: ID number</li>
<li><code>firstname</code>: First name of laureate</li>
<li><code>surname</code>: Surname</li>
<li><code>year</code>: Year prize won</li>
<li><code>category</code>: Category of prize</li>
<li><code>affiliation</code>: Affiliation of laureate</li>
<li><code>city</code>: City of laureate in prize year</li>
<li><code>country</code>: Country of laureate in prize year</li>
<li><code>born_date</code>: Birth date of laureate</li>
<li><code>died_date</code>: Death date of laureate</li>
<li><code>gender</code>: Gender of laureate</li>
<li><code>born_city</code>: City where laureate was born</li>
<li><code>born_country</code>: Country where laureate was born</li>
<li><code>born_country_code</code>: Code of country where laureate was born</li>
<li><code>died_city</code>: City where laureate died</li>
<li><code>died_country</code>: Country where laureate died</li>
<li><code>died_country_code</code>: Code of country where laureate died</li>
<li><code>overall_motivation</code>: Overall motivation for recognition</li>
<li><code>share</code>: Number of other winners award is shared with</li>
<li><code>motivation</code>: Motivation for recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>In a few cases the name of the city/country changed after laureate was given (e.g.¬†in 1975 Bosnia and Herzegovina was called the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia).
In these cases the variables below reflect a different name than their counterparts without the suffix `_original`.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>born_country_original</code>: Original country where laureate was born</li>
<li><code>born_city_original</code>: Original city where laureate was born</li>
<li><code>died_country_original</code>: Original country where laureate died</li>
<li><code>died_city_original</code>: Original city where laureate died</li>
<li><code>city_original</code>: Original city where laureate lived at the time of winning the award</li>
<li><code>country_original</code>: Original country where laureate lived at the time of winning the award</li>
</ul>

<h2>Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes</h2>
<p>‚Ä¶ says the Buzzfeed article.
Let‚Äôs see if that‚Äôs true.</p>
<p>First, we‚Äôll create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize.
We‚Äôll use the <code>mutate()</code> function for this.
The following pipeline mutates the <code>nobel_living</code> data frame by adding a new variable called <code>country_us</code>.
We use an if statement to create this variable.
The first argument in the <code>if_else()</code> function we‚Äôre using to write this if statement is the condition we‚Äôre testing for.
If <code>country</code> is equal to <code>"USA"</code>, we set <code>country_us</code> to <code>"USA"</code>.
If not, we set the <code>country_us</code> to <code>"Other"</code>.</p>
<pre class="marginfigure"><code>Note that we can achieve the same result using the `fct_other()` function we&#39;ve seen before (i.e. with `country_us = fct_other(country, &quot;USA&quot;)`). We decided to use the `if_else()` here to show you one example of an if statement in R.</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>nobel_living &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%
  mutate(
    country_us = if_else(country == &quot;USA&quot;, &quot;USA&quot;, &quot;Other&quot;)
  )</code></pre>
<p>Next, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nobel_living_science &lt;- nobel_living %&gt;%
  filter(category %in% c(&quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;Medicine&quot;, &quot;Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Economics&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>For the next exercise work with the <code>nobel_living_science</code> data frame you created above.
This means you‚Äôll need to define this data frame in your R Markdown document, even though the next exercise doesn‚Äôt explicitly ask you to do so.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize.

<h1>Interested in how Buzzfeed made their visualizations?</h1>
<p>The plots in the Buzzfeed article are called waffle plots.
You can find the code used for making these plots in Buzzfeed‚Äôs GitHub repo (yes, they have one!) <a href="https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2017-01-immigration-and-science/">here</a>.
You‚Äôre not expected to recreate them as part of your assignment, but you‚Äôre welcomed to do so for fun!</p>
